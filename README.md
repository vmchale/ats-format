This is a code formatter for [ATS](http://www.ats-lang.org/). It is
a work-in-progress, but it can handle a subset of the language already.
Currently it is only tested with ATS 0.3.8.

If you find something that's not listed in `TODO.md` feel free to open
an issue. Code samples that were formatted into something ugly are also welcome.

## Configuration

`atsfmt` is configured with the `.atsfmt.toml` file. You can generate a default
configuration with

```bash
 $ atsfmt --default-config
```

### Vim

You can use [this](https://github.com/vmchale/ats-vim) plugin to enable
automatic formatting on write.
